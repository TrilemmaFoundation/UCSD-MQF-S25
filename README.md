# Improving Bitcoin Accumulation Strategies

**UCSD-MQF-S25**

Welcome to the Trilemma Foundation x UCSD MQF Summer 2025 capstone repository. This project challenges students to go beyond Dollar-Cost Averaging (DCA) and build data-driven models for optimizing Bitcoin accumulation. The emphasis is on improving existing models for real-world deployment.

## üîç Why: Problem Statement

The world‚Äôs most influential entities‚Äîincluding asset managers, financial institutions, and sovereign wealth funds‚Äîare actively accumulating Bitcoin or investigating strategies to do so. This nascent accumulation race underscores a fundamental game-theoretic principle: as others acquire a mathematically scarce asset, the incentive to participate intensifies.

While Dollar-Cost Averaging (DCA) remains a widely utilized approach, it may prove suboptimal amid such competitive dynamics. This project seeks to design data-driven accumulation strategies that retain the key advantages of DCA‚Äînamely, consistent and systematic purchases‚Äîwhile enhancing the efficiency of Bitcoin acquisition with \$1M+ monthly budgets across multi-year time frames. The resulting insights can be delivered through a SaaS integration or hedge fund product, ultimately giving high-AUM investors access to these accumulation strategies.

## üì¶ What: Project Deliverables

### 1. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) (Deadline: **TBD**)

* **Purpose**: Identify and evaluate features for smart accumulation strategies.
* **Goal**: Visualize data and extract **non-trivial insights** that could inform model design.
* **Deliverable**: A Jupyter Notebook showcasing your EDA with compelling visualizations and commentary.

### 2. Strategy Fact Sheet (Deadline: **TBD**)

* **Purpose**: Market your strategy for the purpose of SMA with a hedge fund.
* **Goal**: Visualize and narrate your strategy's historical performance, clearly showing the alpha it provides over baseline accumulation strategies.
* **Deliverable**: A fact sheet backed by a Python notebook that reproduces the results cited in the fact sheet.

## üöÄ How: Project Culture

### Work in Public, Commit in Private

* While this is an **open-source practicum**, we ask each team to push their weekly progress to this **private repository**.
* This repo will be private during the capstone and made **public** after the model deadline passes.
* If nothing is being pushed, we assume no work is being done.

### Show Initiative

* **Ask questions** in Discord or during weekly office hours.
* We‚Äôre here to help‚Äîbut your **progress determines how much support we can provide**.
* Share what you're learning, even if it's messy‚Äî**insight comes from iteration**.

## üõ†Ô∏è Getting Started

1. Check our Discord for onboarding details.
2. Read Chapters 1 & 2 of [Mastering Bitcoin](https://github.com/bitcoinbook/bitcoinbook).
3. **Review the [Data Retrieval Notebook](https://github.com/TrilemmaFoundation/GT-MSA-S25/blob/main/2.%20Data%20Retrieval.ipynb)** to fetch and begin exploring the initial dataset.
4. **Check this repository regularly**, as we will be updating it with new tutorials, resources, and guidance.

## üì£ Final Notes

* Submit all deliverables as Jupyter Notebooks unless otherwise specified.
* All work will be evaluated not only on technical correctness but also on **storytelling, clarity, and educational value**.
